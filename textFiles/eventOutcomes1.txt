Your mom burps you and you feel better
You're taken to the doctor, where they discover you have cancer
--
You vomit up all your fluids and die of dehydration
Your vomit distance sets a world record
--
You puke in your moms face, the stomach acid permanently blinding her
You puke in your moms face, the stomach acid permanently blinding her
--
You burp and feel better
Your burp blows out your lungs and you die
--
You electrocute yourself to death
You short circuit the entire neighborhood. Oh, and you're dead
--
You lunge for your mom's jugular, severing it with your teeth. She is dead
Your mom fights back and you die
--
--
--
Nobody comes to your aid. You die
Your mom sees you drowning and pulls you from the water
--
You accept your fate and die
Your mom notices and tries to save you, but you sink too deep and die
--
Your splashing somehow keeps you afloat until your mom saves you
You run out of energy and drown
--
Your mom sees you drowning and saves you
Haha no you die
--
Sucking in water made you die faster
You discover that you're aquaman!
--
You pull your friend down with you into the depths. You both drown
You push your friend under to stay afloat. They die, but you're saved

--
The dog gets scared and runs away
The dog eats you alive
--
The dog eats your face off
The dog sniffs you and leaves
--
The dog takes off your arm with its teeth
The dog is disappointed... it just wanted to play!
--
The dog disembowels you
The dog, seeing your submission, turns away and leaves
--
You trip and fall. The dog eats you
You run faster than your friend. They get eaten instead
--
You use juijitsu to subdue the dog
The dog chews you like a rag doll. You die
